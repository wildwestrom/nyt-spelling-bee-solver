How does it work? By using some wordlists and regex.
All packaged up into a nice command line tool.

** Building
Compile with this command:
#+begin_src sh
clojure -T:build uber
#+end_src

** Usage
Run the program via command line with this command.
#+begin_src sh
java -jar bee-solver*.jar
#+end_src

** License
The word lists I used were found on various places on the net, I can't remember each one. I do not own these word lists. Otherwise...
